# Profiling-Destinasi-Wisata-di-Indonesia
Tourism is an activity undertaken to gain knowledge, have fun, and entertain oneself. Indonesia, as an archipelagic country, offers a variety of tourist destinations. Profiling tourist destinations plays an important role in facilitating tourism activities. Analyzing the characteristics of tourist destinations requires examining visitation patterns, facilities, weather, and more. One of the most crucial aspects, especially for tourists, is the availability of hotels as temporary accommodations. Naturally, factors such as service quality, price, and proximity to tourist spots influence whether tourists choose to stay at a particular hotel. This project focuses on building tourism clustering using K-Means and DBSCAN.
